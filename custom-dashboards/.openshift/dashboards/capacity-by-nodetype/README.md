# Custom Grafana dashboards for OpenShift v3.11

## Summary by nodetype
Shows summary metrics for all three nodetypes (master, infra, compute). Different type of nodes run different type of workloads, so itâ€™s useful to monitor resource utilization grouped this way (e.g. How much memory do I have to run application pods?). 

Top panels:
* Nodes
* Node health
* Node issues

Repeated panels:
* CPU node %
* CPU usage/allocatable %
* CPU usage/request %
* CPU request/allocatable %
* CPU limits/allocatable %
* CPU graph: Total, Allocatable, Node usage, Usage, Request, Limits
* Memory node %
* Memory usage/allocatable %
* Memory usage/request %
* Memory request/allocatable %
* Memory limits/allocatable %
* Memory graph: Total, Allocatable, Node usage, Usage, Request, Limits
* Network Total: receive+transmit
* Network Receive
* Network Transmit
* Disk bytes read
* Disk bytes write
* Disk IO Utilization
* Filesystem %
* Pods per node
* Pod phase

This panel only works if the standard OpenShift labels are used on the nodes (e.g. _node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true_). By default it shows _master_, _infra_ and _compute_ node groups, but if additional node roles exist, you simply have to add them to the list in _$nodetype_ dasboard variable.

## Summary by nodetype

The dashboard have two sections:
* Summary resource utilization including all selected nodes
* Resource utilization for each selected node on-by-one (repeated row)

The panels are more or less the same as on _Summary by nodetype_.

## Namespaces in cluster

One or multiple projects within the cluster can be selected. Values are calculated for the selected projects. This dashboard is a customized version of the default _Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Cluster_ dashboard in OpenShift v3.11. 

Panels:
* Pod phase
* Pod restarts
* CPU Usage
* CPU Quota: Clinking on namespace name opens the _Pods in Namespace_ dashboard
* Memory Usage
* Memory Quota: Clinking on namespace name opens the _Pods in Namespace_ dashboard

## Pods in namespace
One namespace and one or multiple pods within the namespace can be selected. Values are calculated for the selected pods. This dashboard is a customized version of the default _Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Namespace (Pods)_ dashboard in OpenShift v3.11.

Panels:
* Pod Phase
* Pod Restarts
* CPU Usage
* CPU Quota (Pods)
* CPU Quota (Container)
* Memory Usage
* Memory Quota (Pods)
* Memory Quota (containers)

 Limits and requests are set per container, the pod level metrics are simply the summary of container metrics belonging to the pod. When one container in a pod has limits set, but the other does not, the pod level _usage_ can be more than the _limits_ which looks a bit strange first. Taking a look at the the container level table clarifies what we see on the pod level.
