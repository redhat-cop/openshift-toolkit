# PV Migrator
Resources for migrating PVCs/PVs to a new specified storage class in place without having to update applications with new PVC names.

# Playbooks

## migrate-pvs.yml
Ansible playbook to migrate the PVs assoicated with the PVCs in a given list of projects/namespaces to a new sotrage class.

### Required k8s Permisions

* Permisison to create new PVCs using the given storage class
* project admin on the specified projects
* permisions to edit PVs

### Examples

#### Basic example for 2 namespaces
```bash
ansible-playbook migrate-pvs.yml \
  -i localhost.ini \
  -e k8s_host=https://ocp.example.xyz \
  -e k8s_username=admin1 \
  -e k8s_password=secret \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_namespaces="['test-migration0', 'test-migration1']" \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_destination_storageclass='my-new-storage-class'
```

#### Example for 2 namespaces with PVC filtering based on labels
```bash
ansible-playbook migrate-pvs.yml \
  -i localhost.ini \
  -e k8s_host=https://ocp.example.xyz \
  -e k8s_username=admin1 \
  -e k8s_password=secret \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_namespaces="['test-migration0', 'test-migration1']" \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_destination_storageclass='my-new-storage-class' \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_pvc_label_selectors="['migrate=true']"
```

#### Example for large PVs with lots of data expecting a looooong rsync time (10 hours in this example)
```bash
ansible-playbook migrate-pvs.yml \
  -i localhost.ini \
  -e k8s_host=https://ocp.example.xyz \
  -e k8s_username=admin1 \
  -e k8s_password=secret \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_namespaces="['test-migration0', 'test-migration1']" \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_destination_storageclass='my-new-storage-class' \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_pvc_label_selectors="['migrate=true']" \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_job_wait_timeout=36000
```

#### Example of performing migraiton in two stages
```bash
ansible-playbook migrate-pvs.yml \
  -i localhost.ini \
  -e k8s_host=https://ocp.example.xyz \
  -e k8s_username=admin1 \
  -e k8s_password=secret \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_namespaces="['test-migration0', 'test-migration1']" \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_destination_storageclass='my-new-storage-class' \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_pvc_label_selectors="['migrate=true']" \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_job_wait_timeout=36000 \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_pre_pod_shutdown_stage_only=True

# wait for a "downtime" window

ansible-playbook migrate-pvs.yml \
  -i localhost.ini \
  -e k8s_host=https://ocp.example.xyz \
  -e k8s_username=admin1 \
  -e k8s_password=secret \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_namespaces="['test-migration0', 'test-migration1']" \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_destination_storageclass='my-new-storage-class' \
  -e k8s_pv_migrator_pvc_label_selectors="['migrate=true']"
```

### Executed Procedure
This is the procedure implimented to migrate PVs to a new storage class without having to update applications with new PVC names

1. log into k8s cluster
2. for each specified namespace
   1. Wait for pods to be ready pre-migration
      * want all pods to be in a good state prior to migration so it is known they should be in good state post migration
   2. Get source PVCs
      1. Get PVCs to migrate in namespace with correct label(s)
      2. Filter out PVCs that are already on destiation storage clas
   3. Create destination PVs
      1. Create temporary destination PVCs using new storage class
      2. Wait for temporary destination PVCs to be bound to new destination PV
      3. Get temporary PVC destiantions
   4. Perform pre pod scale-down PV rsync
      1. Create pv-migrator job per PVC
      2. Wait for pv-migrator jobs to complete
   5. Pods scale-down
      1. Get all scaleable resources
      2. Scale down all scaleable resources to 0
      3. Wait for all pods to be stopped
         * if this times out, prompt user on whether to continue or not giving user chance to manually kill pods or abort migration
   6. Perform post pod scale-down PV rsync
      1. Create pv-migrator job per PVC
      2. Wait for pv-migrator jobs to complete
   7. Perform PVC migration
      1. Set destination PVs to 'Retain' so they do not delete when their temporary PVC is deleted
      2. Delete temporary destination PVCs
      3. Set source PVs to 'Retain' and labe
         * migrated: true
         * migrated-to-pv: (destination PV name)
      4. Delete source PVCs
      5. Remove claimRef from destination PVs and update labels
      6. Create new PVC with origional source PVC name pre-bound to new destination PV created in new storage class
      7. Set destination PVs back to their orgional reclaim policy
   8. Pods scale-up
      1. Scale up all scaleable resources to origional replica count
      2. Wait for all pods to ready
3. log out of k8s cluster
